Today I submit my Sinatra CRUD app. It allows users to log in and track their sneakers. They can add new sneakers to their collection, view their sneaker collection, edit the name of the sneakers (more fields to come), and delete their sneaker. It can track different users.

This project will be memoriable because the first week to work on it I had to spend a Cleveland for a work trip. It really limited my time to work on this project and I fell behind the rest of my starting cohort. After I came home it was tough to get back into the swing of things, basic things seemed foreign. I kept re-reading my old notes, going over old labs, and used all my resources to their full advantage.

I plan on improving this over time but for now it's nice to see what my first draft looks like.

Enjoy
