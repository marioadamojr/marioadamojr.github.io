My Rails project was a based around a Food Festival website.

Users can be created through the website or with a Github account.

This was a big task, by far the largest project I have made, and I really enjoyed the process of tackling it from beginning to end. I ran into some issue with scope initially, but it was all part of the learning experience. 

My biggest takeaways was how to plan for a project, function > form, and I need to comment more. This project was full of challenges like making a nested resource work flawlessly, have the app tell if the user was from Github or not, and was my first hand experience working on code from two different machines, testing my Github skills.

This is something that I feel I could work on forever, but I'm happy with where it is now, and I'm excited to continue to refine this as I have time.

I hope you check it out at https://github.com/marioadamojr/Foodfest.
