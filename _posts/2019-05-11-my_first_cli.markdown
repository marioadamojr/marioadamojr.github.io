Today I submit my first project to Flatiron School. It's a CLI I made and I'm proud of. It's not the most complicated piece of software, but I'm excited to look back a year from now to see how far along I've come.

Some background, I'm big into fantasy football. It combines my analtyical self with my passion for football. This CLI scrapes a website I personally use a lot during the season, http://www.borischen.co/, and allows the user to display the tier lists for each position. 

It's a brief liitle tool that I'm excited to share and am excited to improve upon over time.

Enjoy.
